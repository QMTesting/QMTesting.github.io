## Introduction
In the modern software development world, ensuring quality and reliability is crucial to meeting customer expectations and gaining a competitive edge. The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a structured sequence of stages that guides testing teams in verifying software quality from start to finish. By following this life cycle, teams can uncover defects early, address quality issues, and release software that performs well under various conditions.

This guide covers the phases of the STLC, best practices for each stage, and the roles involved, providing a detailed look at how to optimize testing efforts.

What is the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)?
The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a defined set of phases for testing software that aims to standardize testing practices, ensure thorough validation, and help teams systematically detect and resolve defects. Each phase in the STLC has its own objectives, activities, and deliverables that move the testing process toward a high-quality release. STLC phases may vary based on organization and project needs, but the following six stages are widely accepted as foundational:

While these stages are generally linear, they can also be iterative. If requirements change or defects arise during later stages, teams may revisit previous phases to address the new needs.
